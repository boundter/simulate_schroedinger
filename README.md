This is a script to calculate the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions of the Schr√∂dinger-Equation.

As of now it consits of one script eigenvalues.py that plots the Eigenvalues and Eigenfunctions in a scheme, together with the potential.

All scripts should be called from the main directory, or by using make.

The file code/main.py is outdated, code/main2.py should be used.
